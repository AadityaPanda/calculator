# Calculator App
This is a simple calculator app based on Flutter. The *Dart* programming language has been used here to create this app. This was designed to be smoothly run on Android Phones. To test this an Android Emulator of *Pixel 7a* was used.

It contains three files:
### 1. main.dart
This is the output file that runs the app.
### 2. button_values.dart
This contains the values of all buttons present in the app.
### 3. calculator_screen.dart
This contains all the logic behind the working of the app and also contains the display settings of the app.
